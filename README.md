## Hi there 👋
I’m Abdul Hadi, a web developer based in Pakistan.<br>
I love creating websites that are simple, responsive, and easy to use. Turning ideas into real projects, from portfolios to e-commerce sites, is what I enjoy the most.<br>
My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, Typescript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. My favorite tools are VS Code, Git, GitHub, and Figma.<br>
I’ve got a few pinned projects, but my favorite is Lab Automation.<br>

## What I Work With
